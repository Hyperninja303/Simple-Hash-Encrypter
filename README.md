# Simple-Hash-Encrypter
A python tool that locally encrypts strings. 
This program uses the *os* module which calls the *(algo}sum* command. When you input a string, *os.system* calls the inputted {string} with *echo*, and pipes  it to {algo}sum. This results in the summed hash being printed out. 

Issues:
> There is no error system, meaning you can put anything into the {algo} input, and it would still attempt to be processed.
> There have been no other issues identified.
